# ReasonML

[All languages](../gallery.md)

These real terminal captures use a historical development build. They are not current release certification; independent output review and current installed-wheel scenario checks remain pending.

## Overview

This worked example compares `component.re`. Advertised filename extensions: `.re`, `.rei`.

## What changes

Change title string binding from old to new.

## Before

````text
let title = "old";
````

## After

````text
let title = "new";
````

## Things to know

## Recorded output

![Actual ReasonML terminal capture](meaningful-change.svg)

Recorded from a real native CLI through rs-rich-record. A refactoring label does not prove equivalent behavior. [Build identities](../provenance.md).

## Scenario coverage

## Try it

Save the two source blocks as separate files with the shown extension, then compare them:

```bash
intentumdiff file before/component.re after/component.re
```

The installed Python wheel includes its parser components. The native CLI requires a component directory. Compare the result with the source change described above; agreement between APIs alone is not proof of correctness.
